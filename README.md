# <b>Orbital SFML SIM [WIP]</b>
My experiment on C++ graphics and my try on gravitational physics. Currently only simulates gravity between objects and don't have as much functionality as i want.
## TO-DO
- Ability to create custom objects.
- Set image for object.
- Saved game positions.
- Maybe some meaning.
- Meaningful numbers for distance and speed(convert pixels to real speed)
## DONE
- <b> collision system. </b>
